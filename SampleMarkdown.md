# How to Ride a Bicycle: A Quick Guide

---
## Steps
### 1. Get Set Up

* **Check your brakes:** Squeeze both brake levers to make sure they work properly.
* **Adjust the seat:** Your leg should have a slight bend at the knee when the pedal is at its lowest point.

### 2. Start Pedaling

* **Find an open, flat area:** A park or an empty parking lot is ideal.
* **Push off:** Place one foot on a pedal. Use your other foot to push off the ground, like you're scooting.
* **Look ahead:** Don't stare at your front wheel; look where you want to go. This helps with balance.
* **Gently pedal:** Once you have a little momentum, bring your other foot onto the pedal and start pedaling smoothly.

### 3. Braking

* **Practice braking slowly:** Gently squeeze both brake levers at the same time.
* **Avoid sudden stops:** Try to anticipate when you'll need to slow down or stop.

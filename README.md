  Upload any Markdown (.md) file with structured steps — Mapscript parses, extracts, and styles it inside Adobe Express.

- 🧠 **Smart Text Styling**  
  Main titles, step boxes, bullet points, and connectors are automatically styled and positioned for clarity and consistency.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Box Sizing**  
  Boxes resize to fit content, ensuring no text is clipped or lost.
